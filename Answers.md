•	What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.
React.js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It’s used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components. React was first created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. React first deployed on Facebook’s newsfeed in 2011 and on Instagram.com in 2012.
•	  What does it mean to think in react?
One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. From planning to executing your thought process has to work through a planning stage throughout the entire build
•	  Describe state.
In the React sense, “state” is an object that represents the parts of the app that can change. Each component can maintain its own state, which lives in an object
•	  Describe props. 
In a React component, props are variables passed to it by its parent component. State on the other hand is still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component. The state can be initialized by props. and any other method in this class can reference the props
•	  What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes? 
Side effects are basically anything that affects something outside of the scope of the current function that's being executed First of all, you need to atleast know the basic of useState and useEffect. Its a simple component which accepts props. We pass this props as initialState to useState.
